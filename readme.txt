This is my repository for my solutions to the Java I and Java II Programming courses from mooc.fi University of Hellsinki courses.

I am new to programming Java and my solutions do differ somewhat from the "suggested solutions" offered in the course.  At times they are better and at times they are less elegant than the solutions proffered.

However, I think you will find them quite useful if you are struggling with this course.
